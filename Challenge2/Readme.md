Challenge 2:

Congrats if you made it through challenge1....This is the second in the series, we are still at the building block stage and will be for at least the next few challanges, these concepts are important introductions even if some are not totally common these days, there are 100% more relevent techniques around, no one can deny that, we will get to those in good time :) but that should not deminish understanding the basics and is the main reason we started these in the first place. 

This one is all to do with format string vulnerabilities. IMO slightly harder to build an exploit from than challenge 1, but easy enough to spot and ultimately understand why it happens... 

**The goal here is to craft an exploit that can redirect you to the 'vuln' function.**

Keep in mind for some of these now days we have fancy ASLR and such to ransomise address space, for these basic examples you will likely need to turn this off in your OS for now, in linux, that is as simple as running this in the terminal:

sudo bash -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space"

Turn it back on again using: sudo bash -c "echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space"

You can also check status with: cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

As we progress to later challenges, we will start to uncover how to work around things like ASLR, but for now, enjoy. 

Reading Material:

If you want to Challenge yourself...dont look at these. If you are struggling or are new to these sorts of things, here is some basic reading material to get you on your way:

https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/what-is-a-format-string-vulnerability/

https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/28476-linux-format-string-exploitation.pdf

** As always - these are prcompiled binaries, you have my word they do nothing malicious...but a) best practice not to trust people on the Internet! b) also not best practice to introduce obviosuly exploitable binaries to a system. Install Kali in a VM and dump this in there, keep it all segregated.

*** I have also included the source code if you really don't trust me and want to compile your own versions, grab the .c file and run:

gcc -m32 -no-pie -fno-stack-protector -ggdb -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -z execstack -o challenge2 challenge2.c
