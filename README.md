# ExploitChallenges

Over course of several months we will add new challenges to this repo that will gradually get more and more advanced starting from really basic exploitation concepts through to the more complex.

I will add some reading material that should help you along the way.

They are designed for beginners to be short, quick and easy but if you do get stuck, feel free to ask me for some direction!
