# Exploit Challenges

Over course of several months we will add new challenges to this repo that will gradually get more and more advanced starting from really basic exploitation concepts through to the more complex.

I will add some reading material that should help you along the way.

They are designed for beginners to be short, quick and easy but if you do get stuck, feel free to ask me for some direction!

** As always - these are precompiled binaries, you have my word they do nothing malicious...but a) best practice not to trust people on the Internet! b) also not best practice to introduce obviosuly exploitable binaries to a system. Install Kali in a VM and dump any challenge related binaries in there, keep it all segregated. 

** All binaries are tested on vanilla Kali before putting them up anyway. But any issues again - just let me know. 

** These challenges are for educational purposes only.
