Challenge 1:

This is ground 0, challenge 101, the most basic....There is a hidden function in this program with a secret message, see if you can find it by exploiting the vulnerable binary and redirecting it to the vulnerable function. 

And NO - simply running strings on the binary does not count. 

Reading Material:

If you want to Challenge yourself...dont look at these. If you are struggling or are new to these sorts of things, here is some basic reading material to get you on your way:

** As always - these are prcompiled binaries, you have my word they do nothing malicious...but a) best practice not to trust people on the Internet! b) also not best practice to introduce obviosuly exploitable binaries to a system. Install Kali in a VM and dump this in there, keep it all segregated.
